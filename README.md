# RingStarGame
A game fully made by me commissioned to provide data for a psychology test, For a research of UNAM college students about stress tolerance, emotions, etc.

Note: This game cannot be used for commercial purposes and YES THE GAME ACTUALLY CAN GET HARDER because the team asked me for that, I remember that one or two levels were virtually impossible as intended. All the music was open source tho :D!

INSTALL
Download executable folder and unzip all the .zip files inside that folder then run "Ring Star"
